      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Experience is important when looking for a job. It tells you that you
        not only have what it takes to do the work, it also means you are able
        to carry it out in a professional environment. Can you perform under
        pressure? Can you solve problems before the deadline? Are you a
        teamplayer? Can people count on you?
      </p>

      <p>
        The first experience is always the hardest. Companies want experienced
        people so landing the first job will be tough. Our example student has
        made their way into an internship for a small web development company.

          <h2>Internship</h2>
          <p>
            It's a decent way to get some experience. Downside is you won't be
            paid in full and you probably already did some internships during
            school as well, but for some reason they dont often count for actual
            experience since its part of the school program.

          <p>
            It is important to have a clear resume. Google has some templates on
            resume lay-out. For IT however, it may be nice to not only include
            education and experience, but also some way to show your proficiency
            in the tools you use.
