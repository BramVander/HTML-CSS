              <h2>Our Coffee</h2>
              <p>
                This page tells the story of our coffee. We like to please every
                customer, which is why we have selected multiple grade-A brewing
                methods so we can make the perfect cup of coffee for you. Have a
                look below.

              <h2>Filter</h2>
              <p>
                Old school filter style. Coffee filtering uses a coffee-brewing
                filter, usually made of disposable paper. This enables it to
                trap the coffee grounds and allow the liquid coffee to flow
                through.
              </p>
              <p>
                Paper filters remove oily components called diterpenes; these
                organic compounds, present in unfiltered coffee, have
                anti-inflammatory properties. Metal or nylon mesh filters do not
                remove these components.

              <h2>French Press</h2>
              <p>
                A French press, also known as a cafeti√®re or coffee plunger, is
                a coffee brewing device. In 1923 Ugo Paolini, an Italian, lodged
                patent documents relating to a tomato juice separator and he
                developed the idea of making a coffee pot with a press action
                and a filter.
              </p>
              <p>
                A container with a plunger and filter screen that presses hot
                water through ground coffee creates rich earthy taste in your
                cup.

              <h2>Perculator</h2>
              <p>
                In physics, chemistry and materials science, percolation (from
                Latin percolare, "to filter" or "trickle through") refers to the
                movement and filtering of fluids through porous materials. It is
                described by Darcy's law. Coffee percolation where the solvent
                is water, the permeable substance is the coffee grounds.
              </p>
              <p>
                It brews coffee by passing boiling water pressurized by steam
                through the ground.

              <h2>Siphon</h2>
              <p>
                A vacuum coffee maker brews coffee using two chambers where
                vapor pressure and gravity produce coffee. This type of coffee
                maker is also known as vac pot, and was invented in Berlin
                during the 1830s.

              <h2>Instant</h2>
              <p>
                Instant coffee does not get the love it deserves. Are you in a
                rush? No problem, we got your back with the best instant coffee
                in the world!
              </p>
              <p>
                Instant coffee is ideal for to-go: as it dissolves in the liquid
                whilst in motion, being on the move keeps it nice and saturated.
