              <h2>An Ethiopian Legend</h2>
              <p>
                Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to
                the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There,
                legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential
                of these beloved beans. The story goes that that Kaldi
                discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries
                from a certain tree, his goats became so energetic that they did
                not want to sleep at night. Kaldi reported his findings to the
                abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries
                and found that it kept him alert through the long hours of
                evening prayer.
              </p>

              <p>
                The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the
                monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to
                spread. As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian
                peninsula, it began a journey which would bring these beans
                across the globe.

            <article id="2" class="story">
              <h3>The Arabian Peninsula</h3>
              <p>
                Coffee cultivation and trade began on the Arabian Peninsula. By
                the 15th century, coffee was being grown in the Yemeni district
                of Arabia and by the 16th century it was known in Persia, Egypt,
                Syria, and Turkey. Coffee was not only enjoyed in homes, but
                also in the many public coffee houses — called qahveh khaneh —
                which began to appear in cities across the Near East.
              </p>
              <p>
                The popularity of the coffee houses was unequaled and people
                frequented them for all kinds of social activity. Not only did
                the patrons drink coffee and engage in conversation, but they
                also listened to music, watched performers, played chess and
                kept current on the news.
              </p>
              <p>
                Coffee houses quickly became such an important center for the
                exchange of information that they were often referred to as
                “Schools of the Wise.” With thousands of pilgrims visiting the
                holy city of Mecca each year from all over the world, knowledge
                of this “wine of Araby” began to spread.

              <h3>Coffee Comes to Europe</h3>
              <p>
                European travelers to the Near East brought back stories of an
                unusual dark black beverage. By the 17th century, coffee had
                made its way to Europe and was becoming popular across the
                continent.
              </p>

              <p>
                Some people reacted to this new beverage with suspicion or fear,
                calling it the “bitter invention of Satan. The local clergy
                condemned coffee when it came to Venice in 1615. The controversy
                was so great that Pope Clement VIII was asked to intervene. He
                decided to taste the beverage for himself before making a
                decision, and found the drink so satisfying that he gave it
                papal approval.
              </p>

              <p>
                Despite such controversy, coffee houses were quickly becoming
                centers of social activity and communication in the major cities
                of England, Austria, France, Germany and Holland. In England
                “penny universities” sprang up, so called because for the price
                of a penny one could purchase a cup of coffee and engage in
                stimulating conversation.

              <h3>Gaining popularity</h3>
              <p>
                Coffee began to replace the common breakfast drink beverages of
                the time — beer and wine. Those who drank coffee instead of
                alcohol began the day alert and energized, and not surprisingly,
                the quality of their work was greatly improved. (We like to
                think of this a precursor to the modern office coffee service.)
              </p>

              <p>
                By the mid-17th century, there were over 300 coffee houses in
                London, many of which attracted like-minded patrons, including
                merchants, shippers, brokers and artists. Many businesses grew
                out of these specialized coffee houses. Lloyd's of London, for
                example, came into existence at the Edward Lloyd's Coffee House.

              <p>
                In the mid-1600's, coffee was brought to New Amsterdam, later
                called New York by the British. Though coffee houses rapidly
                began to appear, tea continued to be the favored drink in the
                New World until 1773, when the colonists revolted against a
                heavy tax on tea imposed by King George III. The revolt, known
                as the Boston Tea Party, would forever change the American
                drinking preference to coffee.

              <h3>Plantations Around the World</h3>
              <p>
                As demand for the beverage continued to spread, there was fierce
                competition to cultivate coffee outside of Arabia. The Dutch
                finally got seedlings in the latter half of the 17th century.
                Their first attempts to plant them in India failed, but they
                were successful with their efforts in Batavia, on the island of
                Java in what is now Indonesia.
              </p>
              <p>
                The plants thrived and soon the Dutch had a productive and
                growing trade in coffee. They then expanded the cultivation of
                coffee trees to the islands of Sumatra and Celebes.

              <h3>Coming to the Americas</h3>
              <p>
                In 1714, the Mayor of Amsterdam presented a gift of a young
                coffee plant to King Louis XIV of France. The King ordered it to
                be planted in the Royal Botanical Garden in Paris. In 1723, a
                young naval officer, Gabriel de Clieu obtained a seedling from
                the King's plant. Despite a challenging voyage — complete with
                horrendous weather, a saboteur who tried to destroy the
                seedling, and a pirate attack — he managed to transport it
                safely to Martinique.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once planted, the seedling not only thrived, but it’s credited
                with the spread of over 18 million coffee trees on the island of
                Martinique in the next 50 years. Even more incredible is that
                this seedling was the parent of all coffee trees throughout the
                Caribbean, South and Central America.

              <h3>Coffee for France</h3>
              <p>
                The famed Brazilian coffee owes its existence to Francisco de
                Mello Palheta, who was sent by the emperor to French Guiana to
                get coffee seedlings. The French were not willing to share, but
                the French Governor's wife, captivated by his good looks, gave
                him a large bouquet of flowers before he left— buried inside
                were enough coffee seeds to begin what is today a billion-dollar
                industry.
              </p>

              <p>
                Missionaries and travelers, traders and colonists continued to
                carry coffee seeds to new lands, and coffee trees were planted
                worldwide. Plantations were established in magnificent tropical
                forests and on rugged mountain highlands. Some crops flourished,
                while others were short-lived. New nations were established on
                coffee economies. Fortunes were made and lost. By the end of the
                18th century, coffee had become one of the world's most
                profitable export crops. After crude oil, coffee is the most
                sought commodity in the world.
