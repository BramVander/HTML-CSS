      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Your future employer surely wants to know who he's hiring as a person
        and if that person fits in his or her team. So it's good practise to
        give some kind of introduction on what you are all about. There are a
        few general topics to describe your personality, these include hobbies,
        language, religion, heritage, culture, philosophy, music, pets, sports.

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          Make sure your passion for your work comes across. What drives you?
          People don't want a grumpy co-worker. When people know you love what
          you do, people will like working with you.

        <h3>Social dynamics</h3>
        <p class="bi">
          Give some insight on how you function within a group: are you the
          leading type, maybe a perfectionist or do you prefer the background?
          What are you bringing to the team? What traits define you as a
          co-worker? How do you handle stress or deadlines?
